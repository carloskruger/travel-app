# travel-app
This is an app where one can enter travel information. The app expects a city name and a departure date. This will also request a return date. Using this information, it will then go to the Geonomes API, where it will get the country name as well as the longitude and latitude. Then it will go to weatherbit and get the historical data for the weather in that area. Finally, it will go to Pixabay and get an image from that place.
